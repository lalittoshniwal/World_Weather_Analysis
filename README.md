# World_Weather_Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to randomly generate a list of 2000 latitudes and longitudes, use the citypy function to locate the nearest cities to those geocoordinates, and used the Open Weather API to get the latest weather information for those cities. I then used the Google Maps API to find the nearest hotel to those cities, and using the Google Maps Directions API, I created a travel route as well as a marker layer map that a user may want to travel based on their weather preferences.
